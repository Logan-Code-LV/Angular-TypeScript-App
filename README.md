# Logan's Angular/TypeScript App

This project was a fun little experiment with Angular/TypeScript
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Backend

Run `npm run server` to run the db. Todo list items will not show if backend is not running.
